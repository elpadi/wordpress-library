# wordpress-library
Common code used in our wordpress sites.

## src/mu-plugins

Code used for the most common tasks. E.g. slideshows, responsive images, custom post types, etc.

Defining it as a must-use plugin helps with keeping logic code outside of the theme directory.

See examples of the App subclasses for how to get started.
